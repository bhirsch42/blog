Let's take this monologue and initiation from a taping of ASSSSCAT as an example:

  <p>I've linked to about four minutes in the middle of a compilation of scenes. To see more improv in this style, here's [a taping of a whole ASSSSCAT show](https://youtu.be/1otcGrYVSag). This one's expecially cool because Besser, Walsh, and Roberts [recorded comentary for it](https://youtu.be/66hTzfnEwhQ)</p>

Ed Helms tells a story about falling out of a treehouse and cutting his penis, then being nervous about going to school the next day. He says,

> I don't wanna be that guy. You know, I already have glasses. I don't wanna be the guy with glasses with fuckin'... dick stitches.

Then Andy Daly starts a scene with

> I just don't wanna be known around the office as the guy who had one of his balls eaten by a goose.

He's creating a situation analogous to the one that Helms feared facing at school.

An analogous initiation is a way to

1. establish a platform,
2. introduce an unusual thing, and
3. frame the unusual thing

in a single move. If you laugh at something, it's because it made you form mental connections. When someone makes an analogous move, it's immediately funny because you follow that person's logic from the source material to their offer. And since everybody is deducing the same thought path, everybody ends up on exactly the same page.

What if Daly had instead entered as Ed Helms, at school? What if his initiation was situation entirely within the story?

For one, it's a little too obvious. You're not gonna get as big a laugh for something the audience could've easily come up with themselves. It's also a little boring, because you haven't introduced anything new. But it's also less *clear*. The main goal with an initiation like this is to get everybody on the same page. What happens when the other people on stage try to figure out the funny part of the scene?

We're still completely inside of the story, so a lot of the story still feels like fair game. Is it funny that this happened to him? Is it funny that he got dick stitches? Is it funny that he "doesn't want to be that guy?" Is it funny that his friend hurt him worse by trying to help him?

Contrast that with creating a brand new scenario that overlaps with the source material:

It's already going to be more interesting just by virtue of containing new information. But when it comes to finding the funny, properly executed new-but-overlapping situations have a wonderful property:

The overlap is the funny part. The only funny part is the overlap. A new-but-overlapping situation throws the funny part into high relief. We know the funny part of the scene is not wanting to be "the guy" who is known for this embarrasing thing. Andy's scene isn't about being a guy with one testicle, or being a guy whose testicle was eaten by a goose. We know that because there wasn't a goose in Helms's story. The scene *is* about *not wanting to be defined by an embarassing memory*. Because that's the part that overlaps.
