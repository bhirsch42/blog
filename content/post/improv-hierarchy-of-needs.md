You've probably seen this before:

<div class="pyramid">
  <div class="pyramid__level">
    <div class="pyramid__level__bg bg-blue"></div>
    Self-actualization
  </div>
  <div class="pyramid__level">
    <div class="pyramid__level__bg bg-green"></div>
    Esteem
  </div>
  <div class="pyramid__level">
    <div class="pyramid__level__bg bg-yellow"></div>
    Love/Belonging
  </div>
  <div class="pyramid__level">
    <div class="pyramid__level__bg bg-orange"></div>
    Safety
  </div>
  <div class="pyramid__level">
    <div class="pyramid__level__bg bg-red"></div>
    Psychological
  </div>
</div>

This is Maslow's hierarchy of needs. At the bottom is physiological needs like food and shelter, and at the top is self-actualization, which means making art and pondering truth and Big Questions and stuff like that.

These needs are arranged in a pyramid because you can't achieve any level without first achieving the level below it. I mean, you can *try*. Imagine a guy in the woods, lost and hungry, and in his fear and loneliness he carves his name into a tree with a rock, as if sending a message in a bottle to nature itself that reads, "I was here."

He's trying to take a straight shot at self-actualization from the base of the pyramid. Maybe he even got a little piece, but I wouldn't say he's nailing it. The name-on-a-tree move works better when you've just stepped out of your 1981 Camaro (shelter/physiological) at the well-maintained small-town park with a ranger on staff (safety) with your sweetheart (love/belonging) wearing your letter jacket (esteem). Also, both of these scenarios take place a million years ago.

I think improv has it's own hierarchy of needs, with it's own equivalents of the failed survivalist and the 80s teen. Introducing...

    <p>Maslow's whole pyramid is just the bottom level of this one, which means my pyramid is bigger so I'm cooler than Maslow.</p>

This model also assumes that your intention in doing improv is to entertain an audience. There are beautiful uses of improv that stop at "partner" or even just at "self". I have also seen improv that, as far as I could tell, intentionally left off "audience" while doing all the rest. <span class="note">Zing.</span>

For the sake of rigor, clarity, and the euphoria of judgement, I'd like to establish a star rating system for the shows that different places on this pyramid produce.

| Rating | Normie | Improv nerd |
|:--|:--|:--|
⭐️ | I want to leave. | I want to die. <span class="note">Or, if they're new, "Oh my precious."</span>
⭐️⭐️ | Time to get a drink. | Time to get a drink.
⭐️⭐️⭐️ | I'm having fun. | Something's missing.
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ | They must have written this. | God, I wish I was up there.
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ | This is impossible. | This is impossible.

And before we tackle this whole thing, let's first examine a model of a simpler system:

  <div class="pyramid">
    <div class="pyramid__level">
      <div class="pyramid__level__bg bg-blue"></div>
      Audience

    <div class="pyramid__level">
      <div class="pyramid__level__bg bg-green"></div>
      Show
    </div>
    <div class="pyramid__level">
      <div class="pyramid__level__bg bg-red"></div>
      Self

I don't do standup myself, so if you do, forgive me if this lacks nuance.

Some scenarios:

---

>The comedian looks nervous as they step up to the mic.

**Review**: I get a knot in my stomach immediately. They haven't said a word yet and they've already lost me. ⭐️

**Pyramid Levels**:
<span class="pill">None</span>

---

>The comedian maintains confidence and does their set, but the set isn't very funny.

**Review**: There's an entertainment factor to someone braving the stage. Would be nice if it was funny, though. ⭐️⭐️

**Pyramid Levels**:
<span class="pill bg-red">Self</span>
<span class="pill bg-green">Show</span>

---

>The comedian does some crowd work. It's funny. They move into their material. It doesn't land. They pivot back to crowd work for the rest of their time.

**Review**: It's funny! The crowd is alive! When someone asks me the next day how the show was, I say "Great!". When they ask me what my favorite part was I say, "Oh man, he made fun of this guy and... I dunno, you had to be there". ⭐️⭐️⭐️

**Pyramid Levels**:
<span class="pill bg-red">Self</span>
<span class="pill bg-blue">Audience</span>

---

>The comedian does their material. It's funny.

**Review**: Damn, nice jokes. Seemed a little rushed. ⭐️⭐️⭐️

**Pyramid Levels**:
<span class="pill bg-red">Self</span>
<span class="pill bg-green">Show</span>


---

>The comedian does their material, and incorporates crowd work in response to the audience's energy.

**Review**: Amazing. Sick jokes, plus I feel like I'm a part of something special. I look them up on YouTube the next day and yeah, still super funny, but it's just not the same as being in the room with them. Glad I got to be. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

**Pyramid Levels**:
<span class="pill bg-red">Self</span>
<span class="pill bg-green">Show</span>
<span class="pill bg-blue">Audience</span>

Notice that, in these contrived examples, you can get three stars by doing crowd work *or* a show. And I think it's easier to get to four stars by just doing really good crowd work than it is to get there by becoming a better writer.
