I reproduced and reformatted Dan Harmon's series of articles about story structure, [originally posted on the Channel 101 wiki](https://channel101.fandom.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit). If you haven't read it before, or have but wish to again, please enjoy it in beautiful serif monokai.
