What're you gonna do, *not* play the game of the scene?

I love Dan Harmon's story circle.[^1] The story circle is a model of how any sequence of events that is recognizable as a story must be structured. At the end of the writeup, he makes a case in defense of the story circle that I would like to steal to defend the UCB's model of improv scenes.

From the Harmon on the story circle:

> Q: Why do stories have to follow this structure?

> A: It's not that stories have to follow this structure, it's that, without some semblance of this structure, it's not recognizable as a story.

And then later:

> Q: I disagree with your model, I don't think all stories are required to do this or that.

> A: Prove me wrong. It'd be a great exercise. Don't have a protagonist. Or do have one, but don't give [it] a need. Or have a protagonist with a need whose circumstances never change. Or have a protagonist with a need enter a new set of circumstances, fail to adapt and never find what they needed. Or have them do everything but return. The first lesson you'll learn is that it's pretty hard to actively defy this story model. As soon as you get in the zone and you're writing something that's making you happy, you're going to realize with horror that you've accidentally nailed one of the story steps at exactly the right time.[^2]

I think saying that UCB isn't "the way" is kind of like this. Prove me wrong.

A "UCB style" scene goes like this:

1. Platform
2. First unusual thing
3. Frame the game
4. Heighten the game

So, my analogous challenges are:

1. Do a scene without a platform. Don't establish clear who/what/where's at the beginning.
2. Or do, but when something unusual happens (which the audience always notices too), ignore it.
3. Or, don't ignore it, but also don't frame it to get on the same page as your scene partner.
4. Or do frame it, but don't explore the idea any further.

When you try to step away from this structure, maybe to do more "relationship driven" or "slower" scenes, when your scenes are successful, you're going to realize with horror that you've accidentally played a game.

Don't get me wrong, I love playing in different styles. Longform, shortform, fast, slow, narrative, relationship-driven, attack-the-game, themematic, you name it. But I don't consider any of those things to be *instead* of game. They're all built *on top* of it.

<!-- What are the parts of a "UCB style" scene?


The is part of something I'm thinking about for a longer future post about how every theater's style is just game in disguise, or expressed with less precision. If you're unconvinced that a handfull of upstarts in the 90's actually discovered "the way," maybe this will help.
