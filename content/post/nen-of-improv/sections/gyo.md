<i class="text-comment">Focusing Yen • Seeing Yen</i>

In HxH, Gyo is the ability to focus Nen into a particular part of the body. The first and primary application of Gyo in the show is focusing Nen one's eyes to see the Nen auras of others.

Take a moment. Relax your breathing. Find your Yen. Now, focus that Yen in your eyes and look at this still from Thomas Middleditch and Ben Schwartz's Netflix special:

If you're successful, you should be able to see Thomas Middleditch's Yen aura! At this moment in the show, he's playing a quieter character, so it's especially important that he maintains Ten to avoid losing the audience's attention. If you look especially closely, you can see Middleditch is cheating out– a basic Ren technique!

Closer observation will reveal that Ben Schwartz is actually *suppressing* his Yen using Zetsu. Why? He's switching characters! That large, smooth step that he's in the middle of is a Zetsu technique, to avoid distracting the audience with unnecessary movement that's not actually part of the scene.

When an untrained viewer watches improv, they only see what the improvisers are using their Yen to make them see. They can't see how the Yen is being manipulated, so to them improv can appear almost magical. How did that improviser know her scene partner was going to do that? How did he make me feel like he was in a submarine without a set?

If you use Gyo, you can see the performers' Yen directly, and learn their techniques!

Many improv students discover Gyo incidentally when they learn about the "game of the scene," which is a specific form of Hatsu. Before learning game, improvisers in shows look like they're magically getting on the same page. Students who know to look for the technique will engage Gyo just enough to see the game that the improvisers are all playing.

But game is just one technique! By only looking for game, these students are not realizing the full potential of Gyo. If you train Gyo, you can see not just the game, but *all* of the ways that improvisers express their Yen!
