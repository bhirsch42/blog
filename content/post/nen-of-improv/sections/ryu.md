In HxH, *Ryu* is the ability to switch between *Ko* and *Ken*. Nen users need *Ryu* to switch between attack and defense in the blink of an eye.

In improv, *Ryu* is the ability to be solid and changeable.

I'll explain here what *Ryu* actually is, but *Pirate Robot Ninja* does a better job than I can of describing what using *Ryu* feels like from the inside, so do check it out.

The closest I've seen any other improv theorists get to the concept of *Ryu* is in *Pirate Robot Ninja: An Improv Fable*, where Merritt and Hines say, through their character of the Ninja:

> To be unbeatable, you must be like smoke, then like steel.

With *Ko*, you can allocate your Yen to different parts of yourself. With *Ken*, you can lock in those allocations to make predictable, identifiable characters. The next step is to learn *Ryu*: The ability to rapidly adjust and switch between those allocations.

Say you used *Ko* to emphasize the part of you that feels anger, and then used *Ken* to make that choice firm, so your scene partners can play off of it. Then, your characters get into an argument. Your character is angry. They wouldn't back down. They don't, and the scene stalls. This can be avoided by learning *Ryu*. In this case, *Ryu* could be used to shift *Yen* aura from anger to sadness, or suspicion, or anything else.

*Ryu* is also essential to rapidly switching between characters. If you've ever seen a show where one or two improvisers play a whole roomful of characters, and somehow they remain distinct the entire time, you know what *Ryu* mastery looks like.

Master *Ryu*, so you too can be a population unto yourself, and always be the right character in the right place at the right time.
