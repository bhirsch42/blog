In HxH, *Ko* is the ability to focus Nen into a particular body part. Nen users can, for example, use *Ko* to focus Nen into their fist to deliver an especially powerful punch.

In improv, *Ko* is the ability to focus *Yen* into a particular part of yourself.

So far, we've treated the self as atomic with respect to *Yen*. You're either using *Ten* to maintain a *Yen* aura, or *Zetsu* to suppress it. *Ko* is a technique that requires us to consider ourselves as being made of thousands of parts.

If your *Ten* is perfectly smooth, you have no particular emotions bubbling within you, and your posture is neutral and relaxed. Even highly experienced *Yen* users find themselves in this state. Improv teachers will often advise their students to use whatever feeling they're currently feeling in the scene. This is *Ko*! You're already feeling a little bit sad, so to start the scene you just turn that sad up further. The first challenge of *Ko* is isolating the part of ourselves that we want to draw attention to. By directing our *Yen* into a part of ourselves we're already in touch with, we save some effort.

But what if your character has been endowed with a different feeling? Or what if you need to play a character further from yourself in more ways, like a space alient or an eldritch abomination? Any character can be decomposed into parts that you already possess. Parts of your body, your vocal chords, your emotions, your memories. Identify these parts of yourself, practice directing your Yen to them, and see how it transforms you.
