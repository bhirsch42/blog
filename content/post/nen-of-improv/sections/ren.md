<i class="text-comment">Producing Yen • Drawing attention</i>

In HxH, Ren is the ability to, through focus and meditation, produce incredible amounts of Nen.

In real life, it is not enough to merely capture your natural Yen using Ten. Audiences have high standards, and giving people a good show requires producing incredible amounts of Yen! We must use Ren!

Different art forms have different techniques for using Ren. In concerts, musicians can use their instruments as a focus. This technique is one of the most powerful in existence, and has been known for thousands of years. Have you ever been to a concert and watched the guitarist take a breath, then strum a single power chord? Could you feel your attention and the attention of those around you drawn so sharply to the sight and sound that it made your skin prickle and you hairs stand on end? That's the guitarist's aura spiking. Their Yen aura might have been powerful enough to fill the entire room.

Improv is one of the most difficult art forms in which use Ren. It shares most of its techniques with scripted stage productions. Projecting your voice is the most important. Others include cheating out and using exaggerated body language.

If you've ever seen a show where the people in the front row really enjoyed it but the people in the back couldn't tell what was going on, then the performers likely had good Ten and Zetsu, but needed more training in Ren.

Hotspot is a good warmup for Ren.
