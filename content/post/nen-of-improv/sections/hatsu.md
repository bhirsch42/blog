<i class="text-comment">Expressing Yen • Speaking • Performing • Taking action</i>

In HxH, Hatsu is the personal expression of one's Nen. It's the ability to project one's aura to a certain function. This could be to strenghthen your body offensively and defensively, or perform any number of special abilities, such as conjuring Nen weapons or transforming Nen into electricity.

In real life, Hatsu is what we do with people's attention once we have it. First we gather our Yen with Ten, so as to avoid losing any attention. Then we produce more Yen with Ren, to gain as much attention as possible. The final step is to *use* all of the Yen we have produced.

Have you ever seen a young child run into the room and gather everybody's attention? Maybe by insisting that they have a song they want to sing, or a trick they wish to perform? But then, once all eyes are on them, they're at a loss. This child has employed a crude version of Ren, but has yet to learn Hatsu. A similar fate awaits any improv team that is better at introducing short form games it is at playing them.

Hatsu is the fun part; the part you've been waiting for. Ten, Zetsu, and Ren are basically the same for all improvisers. Hatsu is where you make your Yen *yours*.

Hatsu is any expression of Yen, anything you do with the attention you've garnered. It could be delivering a line, making a face, or singing a song. It could be projecting your Yen onto someone else to make their move stronger. There are infinite ways to use Hatsu; take joy in discovering as many as you can. This is where Yen becomes improv.
