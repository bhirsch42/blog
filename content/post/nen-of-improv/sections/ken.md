In HxH, *Ken* is the ability to combine *Ten* and *Ren* to maintain an extra dense defensive layer of Nen aura around one's body, and maintain that layer for an extended period.

In improv, *Ken* is the ability to be predictable. If *Ko* is the ability to allocate *Yen* to different parts of yourself, *Ken* is the ability to lock that configuration in.

Say you're playing a robot. You use *Ko* to direct a lot of Yen to the evenness of your voice, a grating timbre, and joint rigidity. But then, you decide you need to play a second robot, so you shift some *Yen* from joint rigidity to evenness of voice, to differentiate this new robot from the old one. As the scene goes on, the audience, your scene partners, and eventually even you lose track of which robot is which. This is a failing of *Ken*!

*Ken* can grant your moves incredible clarity. It can also grant them a useful predictability. If your *Ken* is strong, not only will you know who you are, but your scene partners and the audience will too. That makes it easier for your scene partners to play off of you. The result of effective *Ko* is a new behavior. The result of effective *Ken* is predictable behavior. And the fun to be had with a new, predictable behavior is endless.
