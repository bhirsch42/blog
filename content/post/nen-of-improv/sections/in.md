In HxH, *In* is the ability to hide one's aura without turning it off. For example, Hisoka has to ability to make his Nen stick to people and objects. To prevent his enemies from noticing where he's stuck his Nen, he uses In to make it difficult to see. Kirapika can conjure chains, then use In to render them invisible. Useful for wrapping up opponents without them noticing!

In improv, In is the ability to conceal your Yenâ€“to conceal the way in which you are manipulating the audience's attention, and the attention of your fellow improvisers. When you use In, only improvisers trained in Gyo will be able to see your Yen.

"Framing the game" is an In technique. The concept of game is known to the improvisers, but unknown to the audience. An improviser uses Hatsu to say a line of dialogue in reaction to their scene partner, but uses In to disguise that they're actually underscoring the unusual thing. Then, when all of the improvisers start hitting the game, watchers who can't use Gyo think it's magic!

Perhaps you've heard the note, "the audience is ahead of you". It means that you've lost the ability to surprise the audience because they can already tell what jokes you're setting up. This occurs when the audience's Gyo is stronger than your In. One solution is to be patient in scenes and look for less obvious games that can be more easily disguised with In. Another is to improve your acting ability, so your reactions feel more natural and less like set-ups.

It can be very challenging to make an audience of improvisers think, "How did they do that?". Fortunately, as we advance in the craft, we learn to replace our sense of wonder with an appreciation of technique. Just because you can see through someone's In doesn't mean that they are not a skilled Yen-user.
