Yen is the power of attention. All objects in the universe emit some Yen, which is why we notice them in the first place! Anything that emits Yen draws attention. Things in nature emit particularly strong Yen, drawing children to do things like play with bugs and climb trees. Few things in the universe emit as much natural Yen as baby animals, the consequences of which are evident.

  "Yen" is a loose portmanteau of "Yes And". Togashi, who created *Hunter X Hunter* and Nen, was actually pretty lazy, and renaming "Yen" to "Nen" was his only departure from the real-life vocabulary.

It has been theorized that there exist things in the universe that emit no Yen at all, but such claims tend to be dismissed because anyone who tries to test them gets distracted.

Yen is also the ability to direct one's own attention. When a baseball coach tells a batter to keep their eye on the ball, that's Yen training! Focusing on something, directing your Yen at it, also increases its Yen, which is why when one person is looking at something, others will turn to look at it too.

Humans naturally emit quite strong Yen, especially in comparison to inanimate objects (though the margin can be narrow, as in the case of fidget spinners). Performers train their Yen in order to command the attention of entire arenas full of people, or so their Yen can survive being transmitted digitally.

Since so many people are ignorant of Yen, they end up training it incidentally, using techniques such as "Meisner" or "Zip Zap Zop". These are excellent tools, but they can be made much more effective by recognizing which Yen principles are being trained!
