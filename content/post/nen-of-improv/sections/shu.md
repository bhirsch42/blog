In HxH, *Shu* is the ability to enshroud an object in Nen, strengthening it. With this technique, Nen users can cut metal with playing cards and dig through mountains with ordinary shovels.

In improv, *Shu* is tricky.

The most obvious use of *Shu* in real life puppetry. Skilled puppeteers enshroud their puppets in their Yen, leaving almost none for their own bodies. That's why, even if you specifically try to keep your eyes on a puppet's operator, your eyes are inexorably drawn back to the puppet. Other examples include musicians (as mentioned prior) and, strikingly, the monologue in Hamlet where the guy holds the skull. Go watch a skilled performance of that monologue and tell me you can't *fell* the sheer *Yen* coming off of that skull.

Back to improv– we do have real objects contend with onstage. Chairs! And when dealing with chairs, *Shu* is characterized by *deliberateness*. Without *Shu*, chairs are often in the way, or end up stuck in one spot on stage for an entire show, or make a horrible din when dragged around, or are used interchangeably as tables, beds, and actual chairs.

Chairs can be a marvelous tool when enshrouded in *Yen*. They can be beds, chairs, stools, and operating tables. Moving one chair slightly can seamlessly transition a scene from one location to another. If they're light, you can use two of them to walk around like you're really tall. But all these powers are only available to those who use *Shu*. Moving chairs should be quick, quiet, and efficient. The intention behind moving them should be clear. Anything less, and they will impede the flow of *Yen* onstage.

And now the trickiness. In every other craft save clown and mime, *Shu* is used to enshroud actual, physical objects in *Yen*. We have it harder. For us, mastery of *Shu* requres to the ability to ehshroud objects that aren't actually there. That is the meaning of space work, or object work, or object space, or whatever they call it at your theater. There are too many associated techniques to discuss here. Suffice to say, take a clown class if you get the chance. They are masters of the *Shu* techniques you need on an improv stage.

A critical application of *En* is maintaining awareness of all the *Yen* onstage being used to enshroud imaginary objects. A lapse in *En* could mean walking through an imaginary table, causing all of the *Yen* invested in it to be lost. I'm sure you know what that loss feels like.
