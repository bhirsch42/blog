  Capturing Yen • Listening • Stage Presence

In <i>Hunter X Hunter</i>, Ten is the ability to shroud one's body in Nen. Ordinarily, what little aura untrained people produce leaks away, and so cannot be used to strengthen their attack and defense, or be used in special abilities.

In real life, Ten is the ability to keep people's attention. People untrained in Ten might draw people's eyes for a moment, but then those eyes wander. When someone is "awkward," this means that their Yen dissapates very quickly, almost warding people's eyes away from them!

Ten is also about controlling your own attention. You can't do a good show if you're not focused on your scene partners.
By maintaining Ten, you can keep your attention on the scene. Plus, perhaps unintuitively, focusing on others makes it easier for others to focus on you. This is the true power of Yen!

Mastering Ten is an essential first step to doing good improv. Perhaps you've had the experience of going to an improv show where many of the performers could not use Ten, and the entire time you wanted to look away. This is the consequence of skipping basic training!

People vary wildly in their natural Ten abilities. As in all things, it's important to only focus on how to make your own Ten stronger, not the abilities of others! And besides, if you think you might struggle with Ten, there are still other techniques that can allow you to get an edge.

In everyday life, small practices like making eye contact, relaxing your jaw, and actively listening can improve your Ten. There are also many exercises for improving Ten in the context of improv, including most improv warmups.

  Ren, which we will discuss later, is about *producing* Yen. This is different from Ten, which is about not letting Yen escape.

Zip Zap Zop, Big Booty, and Electric Company are all Ten exercises. They train you to focus on your scene partners. Three line scenes are a Ten exercise as well. They force you to quickly engage Ten to listen and respond.

Both times I've taken a workshop from Jonathan Pitts, a former Second City improv teacher and skilled Yen user, he ran a very simple and incredibly powerful Ten exercise. Two people would do a scene, and each time an improviser spoke, Jonathan would ask their scene partner, "What did they just say?". Then the person he was questioning would have to repeat it word-for-word. Like this:

> *<span class="text-orange">Alice</span> and <span class="text-blue">Bob</span> are doing a scene.*

> <span class="text-orange">Alice:</span> This is my favorite laundromat.

> <span class="text-green">Jonathan:</span> Bob, what did Alice just say?

> <span class="text-blue">Bob:</span> "This is my favorite laundromat."

> <span class="text-green">Jonathan:</span> Good.

> <span class="text-blue">Bob:</span> Sometimes I come to this laundromat to write, or even just to think.

> <span class="text-green">Jonathan:</span> Alice, what did Bob just say?

Jonathan would do it after every line. The crazy part? People would forget over and over. They'd usually forget the *very first line* the were asked to repeat. Almost always because they were too busy thinking about what they were going to say to listen to their scene partner. Why is this so damaging? Speech is a use of *Hatsu*, the *fourth* major principle. Using Hatsu without exercising Ten is a surefire way to let all of the Yen escape from your scene. A recipe for disaster!

You will be able to feel it when you're using Ten successfully. You will be shrouded in Yen. If you're onstage, even if you're not doing much at all, the audience will be focused on you. Not only that– you will feel present and engaged with your scene partner, as your focus is sharpened by your own captured Yen.
