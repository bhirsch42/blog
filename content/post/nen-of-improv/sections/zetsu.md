<i class="text-comment">Stopping Yen • Avoiding attention • Increasing sensitivity</i>

In *Hunter X Hunter*, Zetsu is the ability to stop the flow of Nen aura altogether. This is crucial when stalking prey. Many creatures can passively detect aura, and skilled Nen users can detect even the tinest amount of aura from a distance. Using Zetsu also makes Nen users more sensitive to the auras of others.

In real life, Zetsu is the ability to stop the flow of Yen, so as to avoid attracting any attention whatsoever. And just as in HxH, in this state you are especially sensitive to others' Yen.

You may already have practice using Zetsu. Whenever the teacher asks a question and looks around the room for a student to call on, and you make yourself as small and invisible as possible, that's Zetsu! Notice that, in those moments, you are also especially sensitive to the teacher's movements.

In improv, Zetsu is essential when on the back line. If you've seen a show where people not in the scene are laughing, nudging each other, and joking to the point of distraction, you understand why Zetsu is so important. Performers in high school theater productions are notorious for their lack of Zetsu training, often being audible over the show even from the wings.

Engaging Zetsu is simple! Avoid fidgeting (if possible), avoid chit-chat, plant your feet, and take advantage of your increased sensitivity to pay extra-close attention to the scene.

When you are in the scene, use Ten. When you are not in the scene, use Zetsu. If you relax your Zetsu when not in the scene, you risk distracting the audience and disrupting the Yen of the performers in the scene.
