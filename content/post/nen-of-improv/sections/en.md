In HxH, *En* is a technique where one expands their aura to encompass their surroundings, or when exercised with enough skill, an entire battlefield. With *Ten*, Nen users become sensitive enough to their aura to sense disturbances up to a few inches away from their skin. With *En*, Nen users can sense presences and movements within a range of tens or hundreds of feet.

In improv, *En* is much the same. The technique allows you to sense presences, movement, and Yen auras within a greater range. If you are skilled in *Ten* you receive *Yen* from moves directed at you, but if someone uses a Yen ability at a distance, like entering the scene from across the stage behind you, you will not notice. Since *Yen* is the power of attention, if something goes unnoticed, *Yen* aura is lost. Furthermore, an unknown presence can surprise you, and rattle *Yen* that might otherwise have been easily under your control.

Ultimately, *En* is an advanced form of listening. The listening element of *Ten* allows you to receive everything said and done in front of you, using your eyes and ears. *En* requires listening with your entire body. It is sometimes referred to as "soft focus". Typically, you attention is focused entirely on the center of your vision, as when you are reading. But you can also direct your attention to the edges of your vision, like when you look at someone out of the corner of your eye, or notice someone sidle up next to you to ask if you're in line when, no, you're still reading the menu.

You can also sense your surroundings through observing the attention of others. If you're looking at your scene partner, hear a faint shuffle behind you, and notice your scene partner glance over your shoulder for a moment, you are using *En* techniques to maintain awareness of your surroundings.

Master *En*, and no *Yen* generated on your stage will ever be lost, and the only surprises you experience will be welcome ones.
