## Intro

![HxH Banner](/images/nen-of-improv/hxh-banner.jpg)

In my favorite anime, <i>Hunter X Hunter</i>, humans (and overrepresented ants) have the ability to harness <span class="text-yellow">Nen</span>. Nen is a life-energy or aura genererated by one's body that can, with training, be emitted and controlled through microphyles on the surface of the skin.[^1] Skilled users of Nen can achieve great physical feats, and have the capacity to become Pro Hunters!

[^1]: Would people be mad about midichlorians if they'd been introduced immediately?

I love this show so much because Nen is based on a real-life principle, <span class="text-red">Yen</span>, that is harnessed by improvisers (and artists of all kinds) to direct and manipulate their own attention, and the attention of an audience.

Incredibly, more people have seen <i>Hunter X Hunter</i> than have heard of Yen, so I've written this guide for fans of the show to learn about Nen's real life counterpart, and what it can do for their improv.

## The Four Major Principles

The four major principles of Yen (or Nen in HxH) are Ten, Zetsu, Ren, and Hatsu. They will form the foundation of your Yen training.

## Advanced Techniques

Now that you've learned the four major principles of Yen, it is time to apply them. By combining the four principles, you can make moves onstage that will amaze audiences and leave no question that you are a Pro Improvier!

There are seven advanced techniques: Gyo, In, En, Shu, Ko, Ken, and Ryu. While the four major principles are relevant to all types of performance, these advanced techniques (as well as the specializations listed after) are more specific to improv.

### 1) Gyo

<!--

Gyo - The ability to focus nen into a particular body part. By focusing it in your eyes, you can see moves that the audience cannot. Use Gyo when watching great improvisers play to see how they do it!

In - Hide your aura without turning it off. Use it to make subtle physical moves, like adding sound effects, playing inanimate objects, scene painting. Object work WITHOUT scene painting. Brushing shoulders, putting a glass on an unestablished surface.

En - Expand one's ren in a radius. Hyperactive listening and sensitivity. Soft focus. Attention to the audience.

Shu - Enshroud an object in nen. Using the environment, walk the stage before a show. Learn where the doors and windows are. Learn what you can interact with if you're borrowing a set. Chairs! Chairs! Chairs!

Ko - focus nen into a body part. focusing on mood and traits of character

Ken - Guard against attacks by maintaining aura for a long time. Being solid and predictable. If your scene partners perceive you as solid, they'll know how to play off of you

Ryu – The ability to shift between ko and ken. Sometimes you're the straight man, sometimes you're a character. You have to be able to control how much of each the scene needs from you. In some, you may be shifting back and forth rapidly.

Six specializations

Enhancement - Improv fundamentals
Transmutation – Deep acting and character work
Conjuration – Object work, world building, fundamentally it's idea generation
Emission – Side support, making your scene partner look good. Giving a gift.
Manipulation - Game and form
Specialization - Some people have such strong personalities that you can hardly see them as anything else. This can be incredibly powerful, like when a great stand-up does improv. Joke-telling. Charismatic. *Finding your voice*

                   Fundamentals
Side support                          Acting

Game and form                        Object space
                    Specialist.
