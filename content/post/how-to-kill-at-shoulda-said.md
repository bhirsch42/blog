## As the host

### 1. <span class="text-red">DON'T</span> ding a laugh.

It's tempting ding the bell when someone gets a laugh because you want to milk it. But the audience liked that choice! They'll be disappointed if it doesn't get explored.

There are exceptions. <span class="text-green">DO</span> ding a laugh if you think the choice will make the reality of the scene unclear, or if exploring it will make any of your improvisers uncomfortable, or even if you think you know better than the audience about what will make the rest of the scene funny.

### 2. <span class="text-green">DO</span> ding clear offers that do not get a significant audience response.

If the audience is small or just not feelin' it yet, you can substitute audience response with whether YOU think the offer is funny or interesting or worth exploring.

### 3. Push your players.

Your improvisers might have some backup ideas locked and loaded. Flush them out. Make them think of something right in that moment.

### 4. There's no "right" number of times to ding in a row.

If you ding an offer and their next one gets a laugh, let it ride. You don't have to "rule of three's" it. Conversely, if you've dinged them three times and none of their ideas are landing, keep going. It's fun to watch them squirm. If they're _really_ struggling let them off the hook. Six dings without any interesting ideas probably means they're making offers that are too similar to one another anyway, so move on.

### 5. Turn up the heat.

Ding something in the first thirty seconds of the scene. If you don't, the audience starts to wonder if you forgot what game you're playing. Take it kind of easy at the start. Let your improvisers establish a solid platform, but turn it up as the game continues. By the end, every third line should be gettin' that ding.

## As an improviser

### 1. Make economical offers.

If you establish three things in a row, or talk in run-on sentences, it's going to be difficult for the host to ding you. Make individual, clear, concise offers. For a lot of improv styles, it's a good habit in general.

### 2. Don't fish.

The audience can tell if you're intentionally making banal offers to try and get dinged. Play to the top of your intelligence. Your best improv is not so infallibly interesting that you won't get dinged.

### 3. Change your whole offer.

How you think about changing your offer is the most important part of killing at Shoulda Said. Here's an example of a common trap:

> Alice: Honey, I'm home!

> Bob: I'm cooking <span class="text-green">fish</span>!

> Bell: Ding!

> Bob: I'm cooking <span class="text-yellow">steak</span>!

> Bell: Ding!

> Bob: I'm cooking <span class="text-orange">veggie burgers</span>!

> Audience: Zzz

Bob's not changing his offer enough. By only changing what he's cooking, he's boxed himself in to a whole category of offers that are 99% boring. Really change you offer! But I'd like to discourage doing it like this:

> Alice: Honey, I'm home!

> Bob: I'm cooking <span class="text-green">fish</span>!

> Bell: Ding!

> Bob: I'm cooking <span class="text-yellow">steak</span>!

> Bell: Ding!

> Bob: I'm <span class="text-orange">leaving you</span>!

> Audience: _Guffaws_

This does work. Pretty consistently. But it also gets predictable if you "rule of three's" it every time. It's basically (2) fishing, except instead of fishing for a ding, you're fishing for a not-ding. You can totally do this and get away with it forever, but to _kill_ at Shoulda Said, I say retire it after the first minute of the scene. At that point, even the newest improv-goer gets whats going on and doesn't need the comedic training wheels.

> Alice: Honey, I'm home!

> Bob: I'm cooking <span class="text-green">fish</span>!

> Bell: Ding!

> Bob: I'm <span class="text-yellow">leaving you</span>!

> Audience: _Guffaws_

> Bell (_having seen a million divorce scenes_): Ding!

> Bob (_visibly out of ideas_): <span class="text-orange">...AAAAH my hand is on fire!</span>

> Audience: _Guffaws harder_

### 4. Just start talking.

Shoulda Said can be _hard_. If your host really pushes you, you _will_ run out of ideas. At this point you can freeze (yikes), pause to think (sacrifices momentum), or just start talking (scary!). The Del Close-ism for this one is "Jump and figure it out on the way down". This moment is why we play this game. If you're really stuck, start with words that good offers frequently begin with! "I" and "you" work great, and beginning the sentence will often weaken your filter enough that the rest of an offer can slip through. When it works, it surprises everyone, especially you.

And that's improv, baby.
