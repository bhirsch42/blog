The tax for this nugget if improv wisdom is you have to listen to me talk about an EDM concert. [Skip it](#feeling-like-a-scene) if you hate fun.

<h2>Ben turns up</h2>

A few months ago, I went to Second Sky fest. It was organized by Porter Robinson, one of my favorite artists and creator of one of my favorite albums, "Worlds" which, at first blush, is just a bunch of sick EDM bangers. But when you listen more, you hear some of that good "this is an *album*, not just songs" kinda stuff. It's got an interlude, some reprises– it really brings the room together.

And then, at the end of the album, something crazy happens.

You want to cry.

And it's hard to explain why! As close as you can get is, there was a robot voice at the beginning that sounded happy, then there were a bunch of dope jams, then the robot voice came back and it was sad. That shouldn't be enough to make you cry.

But Porter did something weird. Here's him talking about the album:

> Almost every single song on Worlds is supposed to evoke the feeling of stories. I’m often asked if there is an actual literal story that I’m describing. There’s not, it’s just supposed allude or give the feeling of a narrative that doesn’t really exist or isn’t real. [^2]

Porter's little throwaway lyrics are all story-y. Lots of hellos and goodbyes and wanting things and looking for things, all in very vague terms. And that's not all that draws you in; the tone of the music sweeps through the *feeling* of a story. It's not a story, but it really feels like one. You can even plot it on the [story circle](https://channel101.fandom.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit).

The story circle tells us, something feels like a story if it starts where it ends, (like the robot voice), and if something really big happens right in the middle. Now, Porter released the album in 2014, but he's been touring the live show year after year since then, refining it the whole time. And at Second Sky, he had a lot of new mixes, and here's what he did halfway through the show:

  <p>I'm gonna drop you in at 50:00 of the hour-and-a-half show.The moment I'm talking is at 50:45, but you gotta get that build up.The moment continues until about 52:00.</p>
</figcaption>

I'm really just writing this post to say, that drop was sick and you missed out. EDM is an arms race of sickest drops, and Porter still managed to do something big and surprising and beautiful and blinding and evocative.[^1] It was the biggest moment of the night, and it was in the *middle* of his show, which isn't how concerts are supposed to work. Concerts put that at the end. But he's not going for "concert", he's going for story.

<h2 id="feeling-like-a-scene">Feeling like a scene</h2>

You can make an EDM concert feel like a story, when really it's not.

You can also make improvisers doing stuff on a stage feel like a scene, when really it's not.

You're an improv nerd, so you know the structure of typical improv scenes. If it's part of a long form set, it's usually platform, find the thing, heighten the thing, then wipe. If it's more narrative-y, as is common in short form, it's something like platform, find the thing, heighten the thing, falling action, button.

Those are the lego pieces, and from their assembly emerges an energy curve.

```
          longform wipe
                 ↧
                 o
                / \
    heighten ↦ o  (o) ↤ falling action
              /     \
––––– o –––– o      (o) ↤ shortform button
      ↥      ↥
platform   find the thing
```
<figcaption>
  <p>By energy, I mean intensity of emotion, groundedness of choices (less grounded = higher energy), and level of audience response.</p>
</figcaption>

Here's the trick:

*You can just do that.*

Things like platforms, tilts, games, heightening, blah blah blah create this energy curve naturally, but you can skip all that stuff and just *do the curve*.

```
                 4
                / \
               3  (5)
              /     \
––––– 1 –––– 2      (6)
```

At (1), instead of establishing concrete relationships and details, just *be calm*. At (2), instead of noticing something in the scene that you want to explore, just *have a big emotional reaction*. At (3), instead of heightening based on the thing you reacted to, just *keep reacting bigger*. At (4), instead of heightening as far as you can go based on the thing you reacted to, *do a flip. Kiss somebody. Yell something personal about your character.* Who cares! Big, big big![^3] If the scene is part of a longform set, you're done! Otherwise, at (5), instead of resolving the scenario based on details from the platform, *Hug! Cry! Apologize!*

(6) is still the same. Do a callback.

I'm being glib, but I'm not knocking this. And nobody actually does this, anyway. I think this is the kind of scene that a genetically-engineered all-pirate-no-robot improviser would do.[^4]

I can't find a source, but I remember a Great Improviser, maybe Susan Messing, said that even top improvisers do a good scene 8/10 times. Sometimes there's nothing inspiring in your platform. Sometimes you're off your game. When those things happen, what separates an improviser who almost always hits from an improviser that hits half the time?

Experienced improvisers can always feel the curve. There are plenty of improvisers who are a joy to watch that never really learned the lego pieces *because* they can feel the curve. That's the danger of it.

From Will Hines's blog:

> **Q: [...] do you sometimes find that some people are so naturally funny that it hurts their longform work?**

> A: Yeah. Though I don’t like the idea of “funny” being thought of as bad. We’re a comedy theater, being funny is good. I think of people who are so funny they change the game of the scene with everything they say. That’s destructive.[^5]

If your natural humor is too destructive to keep a scene together to the end, eventually you'll have to learn the structure. But if you can feel the curve, you can get away with it forever.

<hr>

If you feel the curve but don't know the lego pieces, you're missing out on funnier, more substantive scenework. If you know the lego pieces but can't feel the curve, your scenes will flop if you don't get your bearings at the top. If you have both, you can shoot from the hip and look like you know what you're doing the whole time, whether you're nailing the underlying structure or not.

Porter Robinson felt the curve. You can make some of my favorite art just by feeling the curve. But the ingredients of an EDM concert are lights and beeps and boops. When ingredients as nuanced as stagecraft, language, comedy, and human behavior get involved, you need structure, and when structure fails you, you have to feel your way out.

<h2>Exercises</h2>

Here's an exercise straight from Will Hines's *How to Be The Greatest Improviser on Earth*. He lists it as an exercise in being present. I think it's also a good drill for feeling the curve.

> <h3>Only Numbers</h3>

> Two people up. No suggestion. They do a scene where they only say numbers, in order, to each other.

> So the first person says, “One.”

> And the other person responds, “Two, three, four?”

> And the first person says, “Five! Six! Seven.”

> No repeating numbers. If someone goes “Eight?” you don’t respond with “Eight.” You respond with “Nine.”

> At first people will try to communicate very specific, very literal things. Someone will be trying to say, “I’m mad at my husband. He was supposed to meet me here!” but they can only say, “One! Two, three, four! Five!” They are gesticulating a ton and trying to make “two” equal “husband.”

> But that doesn’t work. You can’t re-use numbers, so there’s no way to make any number mean anything. And we can’t see your “husband,” so there’s no way to know that you’re talking about him.

> The other person can only tell that you’re upset, so they adopt a soothing tone. “Six. Seven.” They are trying to calm you down.

> Then, you stop trying to make specific points. You just start responding to each other’s tone. If “six” and “seven” are said in a soothing way, then you calm down and say, “Eight, nine, ten,” in a sort of “you’re right, you’re right” tone.

> Dialogue has a music to it, and that music communicates a lot. Being present means being in touch with that music.

> Variation: Each person can only say one number. This forces you to use silence and tone to get feeling out of just one word.[^6]

[^3]: Do not underestimate the power of just doing something really, really big. I know an improviser who, if he senses that the audience's attention is drifting, will find a reason to do a flip off something and parkour around the theater. And he's everybody's *favorite*.
